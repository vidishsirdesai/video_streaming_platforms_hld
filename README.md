# Problem Statement
Develop a high level design of a robust and user-centric video streaming service that offers a vast library of TV shows, and movies, delivering a seamless, and personalized viewing experience across multiple platforms on subscription basis.


# Agenda
This document aims to develop the said system, while describing the principles of high level design.


# What is High Level Design?
High level design (HLD) is a conceptual representation of a software system's architecture, focusing on the overall structure, components, and their interactions. It provides a blueprint for the system's design, outlining the key modules, their responsibilities, and how they communicate with each other.

HLD serves as a foundation for the detailed design phase, providing a clear direction for the development team. It helps in,
- Understanding the system as a whole.
- Identifying dependencies between different modules.
- Evaluating different architectural design alternatives.
- Communicating design decisions with all the stake holders.

HLD is essentially a bridge between the problem domain and the detailed design. It helps in laying down a roadmap for building a robust and efficient software system

### Key elements of HLD
- System architecture: The overall structure and organization of the system, often depicted using diagrams like UML (Unified Modeling Language) component diagrams.
- Module identification: Breaking down the system into logical components or modules, each with a specifci purpose.
- Module relationships: Defining how modules interact with each other, including data flow and control flow.
- Interfaces: Specifying the communication points between modules including the data exchanged and the protocols used.
- Non-functional requirements: Considering factors like performance, security, scalability, and maintainability.
